2 info using node@v16.9.0
3 warn cli npm v9.3.0 does not support Node.js v16.9.0. You should probably upgrade to a
3 warn cli newer version of node as we can't make any promises that npm will work with this
3 warn cli version. This version of npm supports the following node versions: `^14.17.0 ||
3 warn cli ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`. You can find the latest version at https://nodejs.org/.
